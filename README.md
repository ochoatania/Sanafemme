SANAFemme ( which translates to Healthy Women)  is inspired by a woman who was once misdiagnosed and dismissed by a health provider leading to my near death, septic shock, and loss of both my legs. . I am dedicated to the cause that will help prevent this type of error and misdiagnosing to women specifically women of color and underserved communities. I am committed to preventing such tragedies through improved healthcare and diagnostic accuracy.
